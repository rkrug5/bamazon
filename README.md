i like books, anybody else like books? (node &amp; mysql app)



So, the first thing my program does is print all the available items and asks the customer if they would like to buy something or leave.  

![Alt text](images/firstoption.jpg?raw=true "start")

After enetering the item id# and how many of them they would like, it returns their cost and asks the customer what else they would like to do.

![Alt text](images/itemamount.jpg?raw=true "stuff")

In the manager program, the first thing the user will see is a list of available options.  

![Alt text](images/manager0.jpg?raw=true "manager interface")

If they choose the first option, it will display the table of available items.

![Alt text](images/manager1.jpg?raw=true "manager interface")

If they choose the second option, they will see the invenotry items with quantity < 5. 

![Alt text](images/manager2.jpg?raw=true "manager interface")

If they choose to restock an item, they will be asked for which item and how many to add.  It will then simply console log how many ot the item are now available.  

![Alt text](images/manager3.jpg?raw=true "manager interface")

Lastly, if they choose to add an item, they will add all the relevant info, and then the program will reprint out the table to help confirm the item has been added and to check the details.
